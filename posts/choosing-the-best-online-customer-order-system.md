When you are selling things online, which a lot of businesses have had to move to in recent years thanks to the pandemic, you are faced with the decision on what online customer order system to use and whether to include an online ordering app. There are various systems for different types of businesses and needs. When you are thinking about what one, here are some considerations to keep in mind.

**Six tips to get the right system**

- Keep in mind what your long-term aims are - It is important to have a system that can grow with you as your business grows. That way you do not have to rethink things with something poorly chosen. When you have new products or services to add it should be easy to do so.
- Make sure you can accept payments online - When selling online you need to also be able to accept payments online. No customer wants to go through the process of using the online customer order system and then run up against problems with payment.
- Is it easy to set up and use - You likely want a system that is easy for you to use and does not require any expert knowledge or technical understanding! When you have new items to add, new deals to add, discounts to add, it needs to be something you can handle without a lot of stress or calls to somewhere for technical support.
- Are you willing to pay or looking for something free - There is always a need for businesses to make good decisions when it comes to expenses. On one hand, a cheap or free option sound attractive but not all order systems are made equally. It can be a false economy to go the cheaper route, particularly if you choose a system that is not well designed. You need the right features and functions for your business. But there are some decent affordable ones out there you just need to look around.
- Are customers going to be happy with the system - Another factor is whether customers are going to enjoy the experience of using your online ordering system or [online ordering app](https://orderem.com/). It should be an easy process to add in what they are buying, get to the checkout page and pay. You quickly lose customers and the chance of repeat purchases, and recommendations when the ordering process is not smooth.
- Consider having autoresponders and follow-up messaging - It is easier to keep selling to existing customers who are happy than trying to find new customers. While you should not just stop marketing to new customers it means making sure you keep your current ones happy is important. This is a way to follow up with them, make sure the process was a positive one for them, and that they are happy with the product too.

**Summary**
