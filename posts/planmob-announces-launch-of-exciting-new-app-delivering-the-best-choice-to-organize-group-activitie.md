Most people have experienced the headaches of trying to organize an important activity and not see things play out the way they would like it to, even if they have the best of organizational abilities. Unfortunately, finding help in this area has often been a great challenge. Stepping up to deliver value in this area is Planmob. Planmob is a recently released iOS and Android app aimed at helping solve this problem, delivering a set of tools that have been proven to help organize group activities large or small.

"We've seen firsthand how much help having access to real tools can be when organizing a special event," commented a spokesperson from Planmob. "The big problem is these tools were spread out and not under one roof. With Planmob we've solved this problem. We're delivering an amazing set of organizational tools that can make running an event go from a headache to near effortless."

According to Planmob, some of the highlights of the app's features include: tasks, where one time tasks, weekly and monthly tasks can be set up; events, where events can be organized and members invited to participate; expenses, where expenses can be monitored and kept under control; a list feature, where lists can be made for nearly anything; amazing chat features and much, much more.

Planmob is available as a download at both the Google Play and Apple iTunes stores.

Feedback from users has been positive across the board.

Christine C., from Boston, recently said in a five star review, "Planmob rescued two events I've had with friends and family in the last few months. I'm not sure what I would have done without it. Fully recommended."
