Customer Relationship Management or CRM is something that has become increasingly important over the last decade. A lot of companies are investing in a tracking system of some kind, whether simple or more complex. More recently cloud-based or internet-based CRMs have become a more popular option. With this CRM you can track your customers, your sales, all sales calls and projects, and emails sent. You get generated reports that help you stay on top of every account you have. Some CRM sites have very complex sales CRM systems and some have something less complex. Some even offer a free version, though the kind of access you get is very limited. Here is a look at CRM software benefits.

**What CRM is best for your business?**

There are many options for CRM now out there some are not much different from each other, some other different inclusions in their packages, and there is a difference in cost too. All will offer a version of reports and customer tracking. Some are easy to use and anyone can learn and take little time to navigate. Others are far more complex and require an investment of time to learn it and to properly use it. In general, if you are a large business you need something more complex and you have the money to pay for it. For smaller businesses then this might not suit you and something simpler and more affordable is going to be best.

**How does CRM software work?**

Most CRM software sites work the same although they might look a little different. There will be a page with all your customers and you edit the information you have such as sales calls made, sale numbers, actions taken. Another page will allow you to schedule appointments and calls you intend to make. There is often also an integrated email option where you can have marketing emails go out to customers. Another page, the dashboard shows your goals and how close you are to them, active accounts are shows and what accounts are in the pipeline.

It also means you can access all their up to date information as they enter it into the system and can track what is happening with their accounts as they move around.
